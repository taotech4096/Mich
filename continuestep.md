What's been accomplished:
  - Loaded 8 input documents (market research, tech architecture, automation guides, migration analysis)
  - Crafted and refined the Executive Summary and full Core Vision through 4 rounds of advanced elicitation:
    - First Principles Analysis -- grounded the vision in verified truths
    - Shark Tank Pitch -- stress-tested financial and operational gaps
    - Reverse Engineering -- built the 90-day to Year 3 critical path
    - User Persona Focus Group -- validated dual positioning (heritage + functional nutrition)
