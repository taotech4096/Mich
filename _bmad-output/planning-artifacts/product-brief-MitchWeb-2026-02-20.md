# Product Brief: MitchWeb

## Executive Summary

MitchWeb is the digital commerce and business platform for **Jocoque & Yogurt Mich**, an artisanal dairy brand producing Greek yogurt and authentic Lebanese labneh (jocoque) in Mexico that people can't get enough of -- existing demand already outstrips production capacity by 3x.

The brand is built on a partnership between Michel -- a 70-year-old Lebanese entrepreneur whose recipes produce what early customers consider among the finest Greek yogurt and labneh they've tasted -- and Taotech, who brings capital investment, technical expertise, and a systematic approach to scaling the business.

**The immediate priority is tangible:** invest in a larger production facility and additional staff to expand from the current 600L/week to 1,800L+/week capacity. This kitchen expansion is the single critical unlock for the business -- without it, proven demand goes unserved and the opportunity window closes as Michel ages. In parallel, three equally urgent priorities must begin immediately: documenting Michel's recipes and production processes through written records, video capture, and hands-on apprenticeship (the core asset of the entire business currently exists only in one person's mind and hands); formalizing the partnership in a legal agreement that defines roles, decision authority, IP ownership, and exit terms; and initiating the brand identity development that enables direct-to-consumer sales.

The strategic vision is phased. Phase 1 focuses on stabilizing production, building a premium brand presence across multiple high-margin channels (D2C with subscription model, branded artisanal shops, select restaurant partnerships, and delivery app integration), and activating Michel's authentic Lebanese heritage as a powerful but currently untapped brand narrative. The brand speaks two languages: heritage storytelling for the foodie and cultural audience, and functional nutrition (high protein, keto-friendly macros, clean label) for the health-conscious and fitness audience. The business will use intermediary sales (artisanal shops, CDMX distributors) as a revenue bridge to fund kitchen expansion while building the multi-channel engine that captures maximum margin and brand equity -- with a clear objective to reduce intermediary dependency as higher-margin channels mature. Phase 2 expands into organic sourcing, grass-fed milk, custom probiotic formulas, and Greek ice cream as product line extensions once the production foundation is solid and the business model is proven.

Market research confirms a significant opportunity: the premium artisanal dairy segment in Mexico commands a 100-200% price premium over mass-market alternatives, and a clear authenticity gap is opening as the leading commercial jocoque brand (Libanius) is absorbed into corporate distribution through Herdez Del Fuerte. Lebanese food consumption is growing rapidly in Mexico, Greek yogurt is trending across premium consumer segments, and no brand currently unifies both product lines under a single authentic Mediterranean heritage.

Operationally, the business leverages an AI-powered infrastructure (including the custom AI assistant Ibrahim, automated social media marketing, and intelligent customer engagement tools) to achieve the marketing and operational output of a team many times its size -- a critical efficiency advantage for a lean artisanal operation competing against corporate-backed brands.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

A genuinely exceptional artisanal dairy product exists but cannot reach the consumers who would value it most. Michel, a 70-year-old Lebanese entrepreneur living in Mexico, has created Greek yogurt and labneh that early customers consider world-class -- people who taste it track down the producer and come back for more. But production is capped at 600L/week in a small kitchen, there is no brand identity or digital presence, recipes and processes live entirely in Michel's hands and mind, and without a partner to inject capital and business infrastructure, this craft and these recipes will be lost as Michel approaches the limits of what he can sustain alone.

Simultaneously, Mexican consumers in premium urban segments (CDMX, Puebla) are actively seeking authentic, clean-label, high-protein dairy products with genuine cultural stories -- but the market offers them either industrial "style" imitations with additives and fillers, or expensive imports with no local connection or freshness. Fitness-focused consumers can't find local high-protein yogurt they trust. Keto adherents don't know that labneh is one of the most keto-optimized dairy products available. Wellness-oriented parents want radical ingredient transparency but can't get it from mass-market brands. And food enthusiasts crave authentic cultural food stories but find only corporate simulacra.

### Problem Impact

- **For Michel:** A lifetime of culinary mastery and Lebanese heritage goes unrealized. A product that generates organic demand 3x beyond its capacity remains trapped in a small kitchen with no path to growth and no succession plan for preserving the craft.
- **For consumers:** Premium health-conscious consumers settle for mass-market products that call themselves "Greek-style" but rely on stabilizers and gums, or pay for imported products that lack freshness and local authenticity. Keto and fitness consumers are underserved by a market that doesn't speak their nutritional language. Parents seeking radical transparency can't find it.
- **For the market:** The growing Lebanese food trend and premium dairy boom in Mexico have no authentic artisanal champion. Libanius's corporate acquisition by Herdez creates an authenticity vacuum, and no one is positioned to fill it with a genuinely heritage-rooted product. Labneh's natural alignment with keto and high-protein diets remains completely unmarketized.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Mass-market brands (Oikos, Yoplait, Lala):** Produce "Greek-style" yogurt with stabilizers, gums, and lower protein content. Not truly artisanal, not clean label. Compete on volume and price, not quality. Macros don't hold up for serious fitness/keto consumers.
- **Premium imports (Fage, Chobani):** Higher quality but imported from the US. Not fresh, not local, and carry no cultural heritage story relevant to the Mexican consumer seeking Mediterranean authenticity. Chobani Complete addresses protein but is still an imported, large-scale product.
- **Libanius (Herdez):** Was the reference point for Lebanese jocoque in Mexico but is now being mass-produced under corporate ownership. The authenticity that once justified its premium is being diluted for scale and distribution reach. Markets labneh as a "Mediterranean dip," missing the functional nutrition angle entirely.
- **Local artisanal producers (La Via Lactea, Dei Chei, La Cabrita):** Offer quality and local production but none unify Greek yogurt AND Lebanese labneh under a single authentic heritage. None have the combination of genuinely exceptional product quality and a scalable business partner with technical infrastructure. None speak to the keto/fitness audience.

### Proposed Solution

**Jocoque & Yogurt Mich** will become the premier artisanal Mediterranean dairy brand in Mexico, built on the foundation of Michel's proven recipes and authentic Lebanese heritage. The solution has two dimensions:

**Product & Production (the foundation):**
1. **Scale production immediately:** Invest in a new, larger kitchen facility and additional staff to meet existing 1,800L+/week demand, eliminating the supply bottleneck. This is the critical capital investment that unlocks everything else. Plan for a realistic 6-month timeline accounting for permits (licencia de uso de suelo, COFEPRIS aviso de funcionamiento, proteccion civil). Explore interim solutions (double shifts, shared commercial kitchen rental) to maintain supply during transition.
2. **Document and standardize recipes -- with equal urgency:** Capture Michel's knowledge through three complementary methods: written recipes with precise measurements and process steps; video recording of his full production process including the sensory cues, timing intuitions, and technique that can't be captured in text; and hands-on apprenticeship where new staff learn by working alongside Michel from day one, not from documents later. This protects the IP, reduces key-man risk, enables quality consistency at scale, and begins Michel's eventual transition from sole producer to master/advisor.
3. **Secure regulatory compliance:** Obtain registros sanitarios, GS1 barcodes for all SKUs, and NOM compliance. These are non-negotiable prerequisites for entry into premium retail channels (City Market, Fresko, HEB) in Phase 2.
4. **Establish the premium brand with dual messaging:** Build the Mich brand identity, packaging, and storytelling that speaks two languages simultaneously:
   - **Heritage & culture** (for foodies, food media, cultural consumers): Michel's Lebanese story, artisanal process, Mediterranean tradition. This drives earned media, brand depth, and emotional connection.
   - **Functional nutrition** (for fitness, keto, wellness consumers): Protein grams, net carbs, and keto-friendly macros front-of-pack. This drives repeat purchase from high-frequency functional buyers.
   Both audiences buy the same product for different reasons. The brand must serve both without diluting either.
5. **Commit to sustainable, premium packaging:** Glass jars (returnable/reusable where feasible) or high-quality recyclable materials. This is not a Phase 2 nice-to-have -- it's a Phase 1 brand signal that communicates premium positioning, environmental consciousness, and aligns with the values of the wellness-oriented consumer segment.
6. **Milk sourcing transparency from day one:** Even before organic certification, commit to full transparency about milk sourcing -- the farm of origin, animal welfare practices, what the cows eat, what they're not given (hormones, antibiotics). This satisfies the transparency-demanding consumer (especially wellness parents) without requiring Phase 1 organic certification. The story of the milk is part of the story of the product.
7. **Launch multi-channel sales strategy:** Build revenue through a diversified mix of higher-margin channels rather than betting on a single path:
   - **D2C e-commerce** (Shopify Headless/Hydrogen) with local refrigerated delivery, starting with a tight geographic radius. **Subscription model from launch** -- high-frequency consumers (4-5 containers/week) expect automatic reordering. Weekly/biweekly delivery subscriptions lock in recurring revenue and make logistics predictable.
   - **Delivery app integration** (Rappi, Cornershop) as a D2C channel extension. Digital-native consumers in Condesa, Polanco, and Santa Fe expect to find premium products on these platforms. If it's not on Rappi, it doesn't exist for them.
   - **Branded artisanal shop partnerships** -- transition existing intermediary relationships from white-label to Mich-branded where possible; add new partnerships where the Mich brand is front and center.
   - **HORECA (restaurants and cafes)** -- pursue early. A chef who uses Mich labneh in their kitchen becomes a brand ambassador AND a reliable bulk buyer at better margins than white-label. Target 2-3 Mediterranean, high-end, or health-focused restaurants in Phase 1.
   - **Tastemaker access program** -- don't advertise to food influencers; invite them into the kitchen. Let food bloggers, chefs, and nutritionists meet Michel, watch the process, taste the product. Earned media through authentic storytelling is more powerful and cheaper than any paid campaign.
   - **Community seeding** -- get product into keto Facebook groups, fitness WhatsApp communities, farmers markets, and food festivals. One trusted review from a keto influencer with verified macros could sell out inventory.
8. **Phased product evolution:** Launch with Michel's current exceptional recipes that already generate proven demand (Phase 1), transition to organic sourcing as production stabilizes and the business model is proven (Phase 1.5), then expand to grass-fed, custom probiotics, and Greek ice cream (Phase 2). Consider labneh in olive oil with za'atar as an early premium SKU -- this is the product that makes foodies lose their minds and photographs beautifully for social media.

**Operations & Growth (the amplifier):**
1. **AI-powered marketing automation:** Leverage Ibrahim (custom AI assistant), automated social media content generation, and intelligent scheduling to maintain a premium brand presence at a fraction of the typical marketing cost.
2. **Intelligent customer engagement:** Deploy AI-assisted customer interactions through WhatsApp and web channels, enabling personalized service and reorder automation that builds loyalty and recurring revenue.
3. **Data-driven scaling:** Use analytics and predictive tools to optimize production planning, identify high-value customer segments, and make informed decisions about product line expansion.
4. **Refrigerated delivery infrastructure:** Build local cold-chain delivery capability for D2C and delivery apps, starting with targeted zones in CDMX and Puebla before expanding. Manage costs by starting with outsourced logistics or small-radius direct delivery before investing in owned infrastructure.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Exceptional Product Quality:** The foundational differentiator. Michel's recipes produce Greek yogurt and labneh that generate organic word-of-mouth demand 3x beyond production capacity. The product sells itself -- everything else amplifies this core truth.
2. **Authentic Lebanese Heritage (Asset to Activate):** Michel is Lebanese. This is not a marketing construction -- it's a lived reality with decades of culinary tradition behind it. This story has not yet been told to customers, representing significant untapped brand equity waiting to be activated through storytelling, packaging, and content. When activated, it becomes earned media gold -- food writers and cultural storytellers will tell this story for free.
3. **Dual Positioning: Heritage + Functional Nutrition:** The brand uniquely speaks to two high-value audiences simultaneously. Foodies buy for the story and taste. Fitness/keto consumers buy for the macros and clean label. No competitor addresses both. Specifically, labneh's natural alignment with keto diets (very high fat, near-zero carbs) is a completely untapped positioning angle in the Mexican market.
4. **Unified Mediterranean Product Line:** The only brand in the Mexican market unifying authentic Greek yogurt AND Lebanese labneh/jocoque under one coherent heritage. This creates a category of one.
5. **Complementary Founder Partnership:** Michel's artisanal mastery + Taotech's capital, technical expertise, and AI-native business approach. This covers the two biggest gaps that typically kill artisanal food businesses: product quality and business scalability.
6. **Clean Label Integrity + Sourcing Transparency:** No additives, no gums, no shortcuts. A short, honest ingredients list AND full transparency about milk sourcing -- farm origin, animal welfare, no hormones, no antibiotics -- even before organic certification. Radical transparency as a competitive advantage.
7. **Time-Sensitive Competitive Window:** The convergence of Lebanese food growth in Mexico, Greek yogurt trending, Libanius losing authenticity to corporate ownership, and a 70-year-old master craftsman ready to partner creates a narrow but powerful window to establish category leadership.

### Critical Path Priorities

Reverse engineering from the Year 3 goal of category leadership reveals a clear dependency chain. Everything flows from four actions that must begin immediately:

**The 4 Immediate Unlocks (First 90 Days):**

| Priority | Why It's Critical | What Depends On It |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Kitchen Expansion** | Current 600L/week capacity is the hard ceiling on everything. Plan for 6-month realistic timeline; explore interim capacity solutions (double shifts, shared commercial kitchen). | Production volume, intermediary revenue growth, D2C launch viability, retail channel entry |
| **2. Recipe Documentation** | Michel's knowledge is the entire business. Capture through written records + video + hands-on apprenticeship. Every day without documentation is uninsured existential risk. | Staff training, production consistency at scale, Michel's transition to advisory role, business continuity |
| **3. Brand Identity Development** | Cannot launch D2C, activate the heritage story, or build social media presence without a brand. Dual messaging framework (heritage + functional nutrition) must be designed into the brand from the start. Start brand visibility before full launch to establish mindshare. | D2C channel launch, social media presence, heritage storytelling, premium retail packaging requirements, delivery app presence |
| **4. Partnership Formalization** | The business depends on two people's alignment. Without a legal agreement defining roles, decision authority, IP ownership, financial terms, and exit conditions, any disagreement becomes an existential threat. | Business continuity, conflict resolution, investor confidence, IP protection |

### Phased Milestones

**First 90 Days -- Foundation:**
- Formalize the partnership (legal agreement with defined roles, decision authority, IP ownership, profit distribution, exit terms)
- Commit capital allocation (kitchen vs. brand vs. operations)
- Begin recipe documentation with Michel (written + video + apprenticeship)
- Kitchen expansion path defined and in motion (location, equipment, permits)
- Brand identity work initiated (logo, packaging concepts, dual messaging framework, sustainable packaging design)
- Business legally constituted, regulatory applications started
- Social media accounts created, heritage storytelling content begins
- Hire first additional cook, begin training alongside Michel
- Identify and approach first 2-3 HORECA targets

**Year 3 -- Lead the Category:**
- Production at 5,000-8,000L/week across full product line
- Category leader in premium Mediterranean dairy in Mexico
- Phase 2 products launched (organic line, custom probiotics, Greek ice cream)
- D2C subscriptions + premium retail + HORECA as primary channels, white-label fully phased out
- Michel's heritage story widely known, brand equity established
- Keto/fitness community recognizes Mich as the go-to clean dairy brand

### Key Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Kitchen expansion delays** (permits, equipment, construction take longer than expected) | HIGH | CRITICAL | Start immediately. Plan for 6-month timeline. Explore interim capacity (double shifts, shared commercial kitchen). Maintain intermediary relationships carefully during transition -- don't let supply reliability drop. |
| **Michel health event / key-man risk** (production stops if Michel is incapacitated) | MEDIUM-HIGH | CATASTROPHIC | Recipe documentation and apprenticeship training start Week 1, not Month 3. Video record full production process. New cook works alongside Michel from day one. Define minimum Michel involvement -- can he oversee quality while others do physical labor? |
| **D2C ramp slower than expected** (cold chain costs high, customer acquisition expensive, revenue stays in low-margin intermediaries) | HIGH | HIGH | Don't bet only on D2C. Build multi-channel from the start (D2C + delivery apps + branded shops + HORECA + community seeding). Start D2C with tight radius and subscriptions. Test acquisition channels cheaply (tastemaker access, sampling, markets, food festivals, keto community seeding) before scaling ad spend. Set financial triggers for white-label phase-out, not just intentions. |
| **Partnership breakdown** (disagreements on vision, pace, finances, or control between founders) | MEDIUM | CATASTROPHIC | Formalize legal agreement in first 30 days. Define decision domains (Michel = product/recipe, Taotech = business/tech/marketing). Set regular partner check-ins. Respect Michel's pace -- modernization should feel like an upgrade to his life's work, not a takeover. |
| **Competitor captures market window** (another brand launches premium artisanal dairy while Mich is still building) | MEDIUM-LOW | MEDIUM | Start brand visibility and storytelling NOW, before full D2C launch. Get product to tastemakers early. Seed keto/fitness communities. The goal isn't retail in Year 1 -- it's having people talking about Mich in Year 1 so retailers come to you in Year 2. |

## Target Users

### Primary Users

**1. The Gourmet Discovery Shopper**
*Example: Taotech*
- **Profile:** Urban professional (NSE A/B, C+) in CDMX or Puebla who shops at organic and specialty stores. Quality-seeking, ingredient-conscious, and open to discovering new artisanal products.
- **Discovery:** Finds Mich products at curated retail environments (organic shops, gourmet stores). First purchase is driven by curiosity and the store's implicit quality endorsement.
- **Behavior:** Once they try it, they become repeat buyers and introduce it to their household. Values clean label, authentic production, and superior taste over price.
- **Needs:** Consistent availability at their preferred specialty shops, product transparency, and a brand story that reinforces their purchase decision.

**2. The Mediterranean Heritage Loyalist**
*Example: A half-Greek consumer who recognizes authentic quality*
- **Profile:** Consumers with cultural ties to Mediterranean or Middle Eastern cuisine who have a reference point for what real Greek yogurt and labneh should taste like. They immediately recognize Michel's product as the genuine article.
- **Behavior:** Becomes an evangelist. Buys frequently and in volume (4-5 containers/week). Introduces the product to friends, family, and their broader community. Their endorsement carries enormous credibility because they "know the real thing."
- **Needs:** Authentic flavor and texture that matches their cultural reference. Consistent quality. Potential interest in product extensions like tzatziki.

**3. HORECA Buyers (Restaurants & Cafes)**
*Example: Greek restaurant owner in Puebla*
- **Profile:** Restaurant owners and chefs -- particularly Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, health-focused, or high-end establishments -- who value premium ingredients. They know quality but are price-sensitive on ingredient costs because margins are tight.
- **Behavior:** Currently interested in the product but held back by pricing for commercial volume. With competitive bulk pricing, they become reliable repeat buyers with predictable orders. They use Mich products both as ingredients in dishes and potentially as standalone menu items.
- **Needs:** Competitive bulk pricing, consistent supply and quality, reliable delivery schedules, potential co-branding opportunities (e.g., "made with Mich yogurt" on menus).
- **Product opportunity:** Tzatziki as a ready-made product would serve this channel well -- restaurants could use it directly instead of making their own from scratch.

### Secondary Users

**4. Gourmet Retail Partners**
*Example: Urbi Shop (cold meats/gourmet specialty)*
- **Profile:** Curated gourmet stores that specialize in premium products. Carrying Mich validates the brand's quality positioning. These shops have their own loyal customer base of discerning buyers.
- **Needs:** Attractive margins, reliable supply, professional packaging that fits their premium shelf, and marketing materials/brand story to help their staff sell the product.

**5. Volume Distributors**
*Example: Central de Abastos (CDMX) distributor*
- **Profile:** Intermediary distributors who move larger volumes. Their end customers likely include restaurants, smaller shops, and food service operations. They're requesting higher volumes, indicating strong downstream demand.
- **Needs:** Competitive wholesale pricing, volume capacity (directly tied to kitchen expansion), consistent quality at scale, and clear terms.

**6. Chefs & Shop Owners (Broader)**
- **Profile:** Culinary professionals and specialty retail operators who discover Mich through word-of-mouth, food networks, or tastings. They serve as both buyers and brand amplifiers.

### User Journey

**Discovery to First Purchase to Loyalty Loop:**
1. **Discovery:** Consumer encounters Mich at an organic/gourmet shop (or through personal recommendation from someone with Mediterranean heritage)
2. **First Taste:** The product quality speaks for itself -- this is the primary conversion moment
3. **Household Adoption:** One person discovers it, the whole household becomes consumers
4. **Evangelism:** Loyal users introduce it to their network (word-of-mouth is the dominant growth driver today)
5. **Repeat & Volume:** Heavy users buy 4-5 containers/week, making subscription/regular delivery a natural fit

**HORECA Journey:**
1. **Discovery:** Chef/owner tastes the product personally or receives recommendation
2. **Price Evaluation:** Quality is immediately recognized, but commercial pricing must work for restaurant margins
3. **Trial Order:** Small initial order for menu testing
4. **Integration:** Product becomes a menu ingredient or standalone offering
5. **Steady Volume:** Predictable recurring orders at bulk pricing

*Note: Additional research needed on fitness/keto consumer segment, shopkeeper recommendation dynamics, and Central de Abastos distributor end-customer mapping.*

#### C. Channel Strategy MVP

| Channel | MVP Status | Packaging | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Intermediary sales (current)** | Continues as-is | Plastic containers | Revenue bridge, funds operations |
| **D2C Shopify store** | Launches in 2 weeks | Premium glass containers | Brand building, highest margin, subscription revenue |
| **Delivery apps (Rappi/Cornershop)** | Launch with or shortly after Shopify | Premium glass containers | D2C extension, reach digital-native consumers |
| **WhatsApp (OpenClaw)** | Launches with Shopify | Premium glass containers | Conversational commerce, reorders, customer relationship |
| **HORECA (restaurants)** | Approach 2-3 targets in first 90 days | TBD (bulk/glass) | Brand credibility, B2B volume |
| **Artisanal shops** | Transition existing to Mich-branded where possible | Premium glass containers | Retail presence, brand validation |

### Out of Scope for MVP

**Explicitly deferred -- not forgotten, just not now:**

| Feature | Why Deferred | When |
|---|---|---|
| Premium retail (City Market, Fresko, HEB) | Requires GS1, NOM compliance, production volume, and brand traction | Year 2 |
| Organic sourcing / certification | Needs production stability first; transparency about current sourcing is the MVP approach | Phase 1.5 |
| Labneh in olive oil with za'atar SKU | Premium extension once core SKUs are established | Year 1-2 |
| Greek ice cream and product line extensions | Phase 2 after production foundation is proven | Year 2-3 |
| Vertex AI predictive models (reorder prediction, churn) | Need purchase history data first; Klaviyo basic flows cover the gap | Month 3-6 |
| AI agent on Hydrogen storefront (web chat) | WhatsApp is the priority channel; web agent adds complexity | Post-launch Sprint 2-3 |
| Custom analytics dashboard | Shopify Analytics + Klaviyo cover MVP needs | When data volume justifies it |
| Multi-city D2C expansion (CDMX) | Requires cold chain logistics beyond Puebla/Cholula | Year 1 after local model is proven |
| Tastemaker access program | Need brand identity and glass packaging ready first (they are) -- but formal program waits until production can handle demand spikes | Month 2-3 |
| Full marketing automation (Zapier, Buffer AI, Pippit, multi-agent content) | Start with manual + basic Klaviyo flows; layer automation as content cadence stabilizes | Month 2-4 |

### MVP Success Criteria

**The MVP is validated when these gates are met:**

| Gate | Criteria | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| **Product-Market Fit Signal** | >40% repeat purchase rate within 30 days of D2C launch | Scale D2C marketing spend |
| **Subscription Viability** | >15% of D2C customers convert to subscription within first 2 months | Invest in subscription UX and retention |
| **Glass Premium Validation** | D2C AOV >$250 MXN and customers reference packaging/presentation positively | Confirm glass-only strategy for premium channels |
| **Channel Economics** | D2C gross margin >55% after delivery costs | Accelerate white-label phase-out timeline |
| **Production Capacity Signal** | D2C + delivery app demand approaches 30% of current 600L/week capacity | Trigger kitchen expansion urgency / interim solutions |
| **WhatsApp Conversion** | >10% of WhatsApp conversations result in a sale | Invest in OpenClaw advanced features |
| **HORECA Proof** | At least 1 restaurant trial converts to recurring order | Pursue additional HORECA targets |

### Future Vision

**If this is wildly successful, MitchWeb becomes:**

**Year 1-2: The Premium Local Engine**
- Glass-packaged Mich is the recognized premium artisanal dairy brand in Puebla and CDMX
- Subscription base provides predictable recurring revenue
- AI-powered reorder system (Vertex AI + OpenClaw) drives 30%+ of repeat sales automatically
- HORECA partnerships with 5-8 restaurants, some featuring "made with Mich" on menus
- Heritage storytelling has generated earned media (food bloggers, press, social media virality)
- Keto/fitness communities recognize Mich as the clean dairy brand
- Kitchen at 3,000L+/week with trained staff producing independently

**Year 2-3: Multi-Channel Category Leader**

- Product line expanded: labneh in olive oil with za'atar, flavored Greek yogurt, tzatziki

**Year 3+: The Vision**
- 5,000-8,000L/week production across full product line including Greek ice cream

- The brand that filled the authenticity gap when Libanius went corporate
- A model for how an artisanal food brand scales with AI-native infrastructure without losing its soul
